\mainpage GnuCashew ~ Web Based Version of GnuCash

First off... I love <a href="https://www.gnucash.org" target="_blank">GnuCash!</a>

Secondly... this is ~not~ GnuCash.  At present, GnuCash code is slightly in use
 here, as I work to connect this to the libgnucash engine library.  So far, it
 is predominantly using direct-sql calls to reach the gnucash database.

This is an attempt to produce a web-based interface for the GnuCash program.
 Knowing that there have been several other attempts, this is based on my
 interest of hacking on GnuCash and also adding additional features, such
 as managed-bill-pay and so forth.
